# Hello, Interweb People! I'm Chris 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **Network Engineer** with a passion for learning, solving problems, and exploring new technologies—especially when they relate to **cloud networking** and **automation**. After initially pursuing a career in law (spoiler: way too expensive and unrealistic!), I pivoted to IT, starting with the **CompTIA A+ exam** and eventually earning my **CCNA**. Since then, I've fallen in love with networking and am now focusing on sharpening my cloud and automation skills. Aren't they just all the rage these days? We're no longer in a [series of tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes) anymore.
